INSERT BINDER LINK!!! 

This homework structures the LIGO Gravitational Wave Detection Tutorial Notebook and companion files as a reproducible research package, with installable utilities separated into a Python package, a conda Environment specification and a Binder link. It has improvements, such as making certain versions explicit to ensure long-term reproducibility, more cleanly separating the supporting utilities from the code, etc.
